# Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines

include::_attributes.adoc[]

This is a sample tutorial to shows the main capabilities of Red Hat
OpenShift Pipelines (based in https://tekton.dev/[Tekton]).

This tutorial walks through from the main components of this new way to
define CICD pipelines.

To follow it, the next requirements must be resolved:

* Red Hat OpenShift 4
* Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines operator
* https://github.com/tektoncd/cli[Tekton CLI] (`tkn`)

For this workshop we are going to use the examples from the the folder __documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/__
 that belong to the repository that has been forked.

[#01-tasks]
## Tasks

A `Task` is a collection of `Steps` that you define and arrange in a specific
order of execution as part of your continuous integration flow. A `Task` executes
as a Pod on your OpenShift cluster. A `Task` is available within a specific
namespace, while a `ClusterTask` is available across the entire cluster.

References:

* https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/[TektonCD - Tasks]

### Sample Task

A sample task with a single step looks like similar to:


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$task/01-hello-task.yaml[]
----

Create this task in OpenShift:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f task/01-hello-task.yaml
----

Start the task and show the log output:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn task start hello-task --showlog
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
TaskRun started: hello-task-run-gng4t
Waiting for logs to be available...
[say-hello] Hello World
----

### Parametrized Task

`Tasks` can also take parameters. This way, you can pass various flags to be
used in the `Task`. These parameters can be instrumental in making your `Tasks`
more generic and reusable across `Pipelines`.

A extended version of the previous task to ask for the name of a person looks
like similar to:


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$task/02-hello-params-task.yaml[]
----

This parameter could define a default value, in case it is not defined when the
task is started.

Create the task:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f task/02-hello-params-task.yaml
----

Start the task without parameters it will force to declare them:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn task start hello-params-task --showlog
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
? Value for param `person` of type `string`? (Default is `World`) World
TaskRun started: hello-params-task-run-xpgv7
Waiting for logs to be available...
[say-hello] Hello World
----

`tkn` includes the `--use-param-defaults` argument to use the default values
of the parameters. The argument `--param` or `-p` sets up a different value for
the parameter:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn task start hello-params-task \
  -p person="My name" \
  --showlog
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
TaskRun started: hello-params-task-run-jqfbs
Waiting for logs to be available...
[say-hello] My name
----

### Multiple Stepped Task

`Tasks` can have more than one `step`, allowing to specialize the task with more
detailed steps. The steps will run in the order in which they are defined in the
steps array.

The __03-hello-multisteps-task.yaml__ includes a
task with two steps to combine the execution of the task.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$task/03-hello-multisteps-task.yaml[]
----

Create the task:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f task/03-hello-multisteps-task.yaml
----

Start the task.

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn task start hello-multisteps-task \
  -p person="My name" \
  --showlog
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
TaskRun started: hello-multisteps-task-run-xq79n
Waiting for logs to be available...
[write-hello] Preparing greeting
[write-hello] Done!

[say-hello] Hello My name
[say-hello] 
----

OpenShift has a dashboard to check and review the current status of the `Tasks` and `TaskRuns` from
the menu `Pipelines -> Tasks`.

[#02-pipelines]
## Pipelines

A `Pipeline` is a collection of `Tasks` that you define and arrange in a
specific order of execution as part of your continuous integration flow.
Each `Task` in a `Pipeline` executes as a `Pod` on your OpenShift cluster.
You can configure various execution conditions to fit your business needs.

In fact, tasks should do one single thing so you can reuse them across
pipelines or even within a single pipeline.

* https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/[TektonCD - Pipelines]

### Sample Pipeline

A simple pipeline looks like similar to:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$task/04-say-something-task.yaml[]
----
Create the task and pipeline:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f task/04-say-something-task.yaml
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/04-say-things-pipeline.yaml
----

To start the pipeline:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn pipeline start say-things-pipeline --showlog
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
PipelineRun started: say-things-pipeline-run-4wsvb
Waiting for logs to be available...
[second-task : say-it] And this is the second task
[first-task : say-it] Hello, this is the first task
----

Or create a `PipelineRun` definition to start the pipeline:


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$pipeline/04-say-things-pipelinerun.yaml[]
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/04-say-things-pipelinerun.yaml
----

OpenShift has a dashboard to check and review the current status of the `Pipeline` and `PipelineRun` from
the menu `Pipelines -> Pipelines`.

image::pipelinesrun-dashboard.png[Pipeline Run Dashboard]

### Parallel Pipeline

`Tasks` will be executed in the order defined in the pipeline, or create a
sequence using `runAfter` definition.

The __05-say-things-in-order-pipeline.yaml__ file
has a sample of order and parallel tasks in a pipeline.


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$pipeline/05-say-things-in-order-pipeline.yaml[]
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/05-say-things-in-order-pipeline.yaml
----

To start the pipeline:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn pipeline start say-things-in-order-pipeline --showlog
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
PipelineRun started: say-things-in-order-pipeline-run-w6fvn
Waiting for logs to be available...
[first-task : say-it] Hello, this is the first task

[second-parallel-task : say-it] Happening after task 1, in parallel with task 3
[third-parallel-task : say-it] Happening after task 1, in parallel with task 2

[fourth-task : say-it] Happening after task 2 and 3
----

And the graphical representation of this pipeline run is:

[#03-workspaces]
### Workspaces

`Workspaces` allow `Tasks` to declare parts of the filesystem that need
to be provided at runtime by `TaskRuns`. A `TaskRun` can make these parts
of the filesystem available in many ways:

* using a read-only `ConfigMap` or `Secret`,
* an existing `PersistentVolumeClaim` shared with other `Tasks`, create
a `PersistentVolumeClaim` from a provided `VolumeClaimTemplate`,
* or simply an `emptyDir` that is discarded when the `TaskRun` completes.

`Workspaces` are similar to `Volumes` except that they allow a `Task` author
to defer to users and their `TaskRuns` when deciding which class of
storage to use.

The main use cases for `Workspaces` are:

* Storage of inputs and/or outputs
* Sharing data among `Tasks`
* Mount points for configurations held in `Secrets` or `ConfigMaps`
* A cache of build artifacts that speed up jobs

* https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/workspaces/[TektonCD - Workspaces]

This is a sample task with a workspace:


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$pipeline/07-count-workspace-pipeline.yaml[]
----
The __07-count-workspace-pipeline.yaml__ file describes
a sample pipeline using a workspace across different tasks. This example uses a
`ClusterTask` to demonstrate how to reuse these objects in a pipeline.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$pipeline/07-count-workspace-pipeline.yaml[]
----

Create the task and the pipeline:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f task/07-count-files-workspace-task.yaml
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/07-count-workspace-pipeline.yaml
----

As this workspace requires a storage, we need to create the `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
The __07-workspace-pvc.yaml__ defines it.


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$task/07-workspace-pvc.yaml[]
----
Create PVC to store the data:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f task/07-workspace-pvc.yaml
----

Start the pipeline requires to declare the workspace to use, among other
parameters declared in the pipeline:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn pipeline start count-workspace-pipeline \
    --param GIT_URL=https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git \
    --param GIT_REVISION=main \
    --workspace name=workspace,claimName=workspace-pvc \
    --showlog
----

Start again the pipeline with other parameters:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
tkn pipeline start count-workspace-pipeline \
    --param GIT_URL=https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot.git \
    --use-param-defaults \
    --workspace name=workspace,claimName=workspace-pvc \
    --showlog
----

[#04-triggers]
## Triggers

Tekton Triggers is a Tekton component that allows you to detect and extract
information from events from a variety of sources and deterministically instantiate
and execute `TaskRuns` and `PipelineRuns` based on that information.
Tekton Triggers can also pass information extracted from events directly to
`TaskRuns` and `PipelineRuns`.

References:

* https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/[TektonCD - Triggers]

To show how triggers works, we will extend our previous pipeline to be executed
with a trigger when a new change is pushed into the GitHub repository.

The main objects related with triggers are:

* `EventListener`: listens for events at a specified port on your OpenShift
cluster. Specifies one or more `Triggers` or `TriggerTemplates`.

For our use case we need to create an `EventListener` that will use a `TriggerTemplate`.
The __08-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener.yaml__ defines it.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener.yaml[]
----

Create a `EventListener` that uses a `Trigger`:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener.yaml
----

The `EventListener` will create a service to be used to access to. If we want
to use this service externally, we need to expose as a route:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get svc
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
el-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener   ClusterIP   172.30.134.93   <none>        8080/TCP,9000/TCP   13m
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc expose svc el-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener
----

The new should be similar to:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route
----
[.lines_7]
[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                                        HOST/PORT                                                                                                   PATH   SERVICES                                    PORT            TERMINATION   WILDCARD
el-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener   el-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener-pipelines-demo.apps.cluster-76lkr.76lkr.sandbox1545.opentlc.com          el-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener   http-listener                 None
----

This command will get right url to use in the WebHook:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo "$(oc get route el-count-workspace-pipeline-eventlistener --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/hooks"
----

We will use this route later to integrate in our GitHub repository as a WebHook.

* `Trigger`: specifies what happens when the `EventListener` detects an event.
A `Trigger` specifies a `TriggerTemplate`, a `TriggerBinding`, and
optionally, an Interceptor.

Let's create a `Trigger` that will intercept an event (Github webook) and will execute a `TriggerTemplate`. Ir order to parse the payload and share that information to the `TriggerTemplate` a `TriggerBinding` is required.

The __08-count-workspace-pipeline-trigger.yaml__ defines it.


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-trigger.yaml[]
----
Create a `Trigger` that uses a `TriggerTemplate`:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-trigger.yaml
----

The trigger includes an https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/interceptors/[Interceptor],
that it is a "catch-all" event processor to perform payload filtering, to get
the details from GitHub repo.

```yaml
  interceptors:
    - ref:
        name: github
      params:
        - name: secretRef
          value:
            secretName: github-interceptor-webhook
            secretKey: secret
```

This secret will be used to add a security check to confirm that GitHub is
invoking the `EventListener` under a security context.

We need to create a `Secret` with the value to use from GitHub WebHook
to create a secured call.

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f trigger/08-github-interceptor-webhook-secret.yaml
----

* `TriggerTemplate`: specifies a blueprint for the resource, such as a `TaskRun`
or `PipelineRun`, that you want to instantiate and/or execute when your
`EventListener` detects an event. It exposes parameters that you can use
anywhere within your resource’s template.

The __08-count-workspace-pipeline-triggertemplate.yaml__ defines it.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-triggertemplate.yaml[]
----
Create the `TriggerTemplate`:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-triggertemplate.yaml
----

* `TriggerBinding`: specifies the fields in the event payload from which you
want to extract data and the fields in your corresponding `TriggerTemplate`
to populate with the extracted values. You can then use the populated fields
in the `TriggerTemplate` to populate fields in the associated `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun`.

The __08-count-workspace-pipeline-triggerbinding.yaml__ defines it.


[source,yaml]
----
include::example$trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-triggerbinding.yaml[]
----
Create the `TriggerBinding`:

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f trigger/08-count-workspace-pipeline-triggerbinding.yaml
----

The latest step is create a new GitHub WebHook in our repository using the
route exposed above and adding the `/hooks` path.

In your GitHub repo go to `Settings -> Webhooks` and click `Add Webhook`. The
fields we need to set are:

* **Payload URL**: Your external FQDN address from the route with `/hooks` path
* **Content type**: `application/json`
* **Secret**: Value defined in `github-interceptor-webhook` secret.

From now every time you push a new change in your repository, a new pipeline
execution will happen.

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git push origin master
----

For more details about how to create a webhook, please, review this
https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks[doc].

If you want to integrate with other Git server, you could use Webhooks, following the
examples created [here](./webhook)
